# Andrew Vaughan DevOps

This project contains scripts and tools used by Andrew Vaughan to maintain his HomeLab and cloud servers. This
ensures that InfoSec, OpsSec, and other operational standards are followed while automating configuration and
deployment of DevOps tools

## Installation

As this project is intended for personal use, it is only made available from this repository. The `develop` branch
is the default, and used as the development release branch with latest features. It can be cloned from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andrewvaughan/devops
```

The latest, stable release can be checked out on the `master` branch:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andrewvaughan/devops
git checkout master
```

### Dependencies

This project assumes that both [Python][python] and [Ansible][ansible] are installed on the controlling machine.
Scripts are provided to install dependencies on remote machines, if needed.

## Usage


### Playbook Usage

In addition to the Makefile, the Ansible playbook can be run directly with as many or as few options as needed. These
options can be run on any of the host groups.

For example, to run only the playbook on DigitalOcean hosts:

```bash
ansible-playbook --limit "digital-ocean" playbook.yml
```

These host groups can be narrowed with Ansible's pattern tools. For example, to only configure client servers:

```bash
ansible-playbook --limit "datacenter:&digital-ocean" playbook.yml
```

### Playbook Tags

A number of tags are available to more-finely control what actions are taken on remote servers. Available tags are as
follows:

| Tag      | Action                                                                                  |
|:--------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `common` | Hardens servers and configures them to the basic minimums required across all platforms |

These tags can be individually run. For instance, to simply ensure the servers meet minimum, common configuration
requirements and run no other scripts, the `common` tag can be run, alone:

```bash
ansible-playbook --tags=common playbook.yml
```

You can select multiple tags by comma-separating them in the `--tags` argument.

Alternatively, you can run all tags *except* for one (or more) by skipping them:

```bash
ansible-playbook --skip-tags=wiki,www playbook.yml
```

### Encrypted Vaults

A number of encrypted vaults are included with this configuration to protect sensitive information. The vaults
available are as follows:

| Vault | Contains |
|:------|----------|

To enter a password for a vault (enabling its use), include it's `--vault-id` when calling the playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook --vault-id do@prompt playbook.yml
```

Multiple vaults can be decrypted by including `--vault-id` multiple times. Various vaults are required for different
Ansible tags and roles.

### Testing

A `Makefile` is provided to assist with linting, testing, and code coverage generation. Dependencies will be managed
automatically during testing:

```bash
make test      # Runs linting and test suites
make coverage  # Runs linting, tests, and generates an HTML coverage report
```

*Please note that full tests must be provided when making contributions to this project.*
